# SourceEditor

A native source editor for iOS and macOS. Under the hood, this uses [SavannaKit](https://github.com/louisdh/savannakit). The goal of this project is to provide a very fast source editor, supporting many programming languages, out of the box. Currently, only Swift is supported. But adding support for a new language requires little work.
